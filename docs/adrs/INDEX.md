# ADR Index

Architecture Decision Records for OpenAIDR. The index is loaded into every
session by a hook; full ADRs are read on-demand when an entry looks
related to the work at hand.

**When to read full ADRs:** before changing logic in the area an ADR
covers. Each entry's one-liner is a hook — if it sounds at all
adjacent to your task, click through.

**When to write a new ADR:** when you make a decision where the
rejected alternative is *plausible* and *likely to be re-suggested*,
and the reason isn't obvious from the code. See `TEMPLATE.md`.

**Supersession discipline:** ADRs are immutable once accepted. If a
later decision contradicts an existing ADR, write a NEW ADR with
`supersedes: NNNN` in its frontmatter, and update the old ADR's
frontmatter to `status: superseded` + `superseded-by: NNNN`. Never
edit an accepted ADR's body in place — old PRs need to be readable
against the rules in effect at the time.
